## Overview
This repository contains my portfolio work for the **"ESG for All" Coursera Specialization**.
It includes concise summaries of all six courses and a practical ESG Data Analysis Project by pulling a Kaggle dataset. The project, developed by me after completing all six courses, bridges ESG knowledge with practical data analytics, showcasing my ability to apply ESG principles to real-world datasets and derive actionable sustainability insights.
