## Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risk scores of S&P 500 companies using exploratory data analysis (EDA). The analysis highlights ESG performance across industries, identifies risk patterns, and links data-driven findings with key concepts from the Coursera specialization **“ESG for All”**.

The project combines analytical rigor with conceptual insights gained from the following six courses:  
1. **ESG Essentials for Sustainable Business**  
2. **ESG Communication for Inclusive Dialogue**  
3. **ESG Value Creation for Business Impact**  
4. **ESG Challenges and Solutions for Business**  
5. **ESG Mindsets for Business Transformation**  
6. **How to Prioritize ESG Initiatives**

## Project Goals  
The goal is to transform ESG risk data into actionable insights that align with sustainable business principles — reflecting how businesses can leverage ESG intelligence for long-term value creation and risk mitigation.

---

## Objectives  
### 1. Assess ESG Risk Distribution  
Understand how total ESG risk scores are distributed across companies and sectors to identify leaders and laggards.  
*Linked Concept:* From **Course 1 — ESG Essentials**, understanding how ESG risks vary across industries is central to identifying material issues that drive sustainability outcomes.

### 2. Analyze ESG Component Breakdown  
Compare environmental, social, and governance scores to evaluate which ESG pillar contributes most to overall risk.  
*Linked Concept:* As taught in **Course 3 — ESG Value Creation**, breaking down ESG dimensions reveals which areas most affect business performance and reputation.

### 3. Explore Sectoral and Controversy Patterns  
Investigate how controversy levels and ESG risk levels vary by industry to identify systemic challenges.  
*Linked Concept:* From **Course 4 — ESG Challenges and Solutions**, controversies and governance issues often highlight deeper organizational risks that hinder sustainable progress.

## Methodological Approach  
- **Data Exploration:** Identify missing values, data types, and dataset completeness.  
- **Descriptive Analytics:** Summarize ESG score distributions, correlations, and central tendencies.  
- **Interactive Visualization:** Use plots (e.g., boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots) to illustrate ESG risk across sectors.  
- **Interpretation:** Connect analytical findings to ESG theory — risk management, stakeholder communication, and sustainable decision-making.

## Expected Outcomes  
- A comprehensive understanding of ESG risk dispersion across industries.  
- Insights into how environmental, social, and governance dimensions interact.  
- Practical recommendations aligned with ESG best practices and corporate sustainability strategies.
